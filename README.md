# GhostRandV7
High-entropy recursive RNG engine with polish-layer mutation and SHA-256 sealing.
# GhostRand V7

**GhostRand V7** is a high-entropy recursive RNG engine written in C++. It uses:
- Multi-state chaotic RNG (6 states)
- Feedback-based byte polish
- Bitwise entropy rotation
- Final SHA-256 cryptographic sealing

### Features
- Deterministic, reproducible randomness
- Built for blockchain, game engines, and simulations
- Shannon entropy â‰ˆ 3.99999 bits/character
- No external dependencies
